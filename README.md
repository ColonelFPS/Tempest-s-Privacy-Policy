**Privacy Policy**

[Tempest](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=944006750921687081&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands) is a Server Management Discord bot that has many features to suit the need of your server, and make the server feel more like home!

**What is a privacy policy?** 
A privacy policy is a statement or legal document (in privacy law) that discloses some or all of the ways a party gathers, uses, discloses, and manages a user or guild's data. Listed below is the information that will be logged while using the bot and what is done with that information. Providing this privacy policy lets our users and members know exactly why some data is collected to better inform them and make them feel safe to use Sir Yeet in their server. 

**Hold up!**
This privacy policy is not our Terms and Conditions Agreement and not recognized as such. The Terms and Conditions Agreement will have what you are agreeing with and the rules and guidlines that come with using Sir Yeet. 


**What Data is collected?**

- Messages and their content as well as reactions
- User or Member Id's, usernames, and user tags
- Guild Id's and guild names, Channel names and Id's

**What do we do with the collected data?**

 The data is used for essential parts of the bot. For instance, in the ticket system, the ticket opener's Id is stored to identify the ticket being opened and to insure that the ticket system isn't being abused by allowing someone to open multiple tickets at once. Other data will never be exposed and will be deleted from database as soon as the bot leaves to specific server. 
 
 **Who has access to the confidential info and data?**
 
 The data that is stored is kept in a secure database and can only be accessed by the Developer of Tempest (tha_colonel). No one else will ever be shown the data for any reason. You can be assured that your info is safe and will remain as such.
 
 **Policy changes**
 
 All policy changed will be disclosed here. Keep an eye here for any changes. The only changes that will not be make will be leaking or exposing any of the mentioned info and data as specified above. The Developer would like to thank you for taking time to read this brief but very important message! :)
